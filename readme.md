## Prework

#### Reading

* [A Swift Tour](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/GuidedTour/GuidedTour.html) (required)
* [Swift Language Guide, The Basics](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/TheBasics.html) (required)
* [Getting Started with Xcode WWDC 2019](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/404/) (required, can skip "Working with Packages and Frameworks" & "Testing and Distribution" sections)

#### Exercises

1. [Install Xcode 12.5 from Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)

2. [Create a free Apple Developer Account](https://learnappmaking.com/how-to-create-a-free-apple-developer-account/)

3. In classic fashion, we'll create a "Hello World" App.  This app will simply place a UILabel in the center of the screen with the text "Hello World".  Feel free to follow an online tutorial like this: https://medium.com/swlh/your-first-ios-application-using-xcode-9983cf6efb71 or try doing it based on docs / intuition! 

* Create a new folder under the [Students Directory](/Students) with your `first_last` name.  ex. `al_tyus`.  This is where you'll add all of your course content!
* Add the entire project folder that Xcode generates to your folder.  
*  Open a pull request and tag/assign me (@altyus).

4. Congratulations! You've written your first iOS App.  If you've got some time to spare, go deeper in the prework reading, start on the class 1 reading, or fire up a [swift playground](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/read/0/1/how-to-install-xcode-and-create-a-playground) or [REPL](https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=18) and play around!
