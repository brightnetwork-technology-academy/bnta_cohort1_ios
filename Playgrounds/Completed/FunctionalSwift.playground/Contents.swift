 A couple of these temperatures seem a bit off.

For the purposes of this exercise, it's safe to assume that temperatures is not an empty array, but do note that normally we should code defensively and check to avoid a divide by zero error (crash).  Extra points if you'd like to add that defensive check!

 This one is tricky.. Let's create a function myMap that takes in an array of strings and a transform function as parameters, and returns an array of transformed strings, essentially recreating the map function specifically for String arrays.  We'll dissect this in class to discuss how the Swift standard library generalizes this to arrays of any type, or try to figure that out on your own!
